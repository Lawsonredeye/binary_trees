# Binary_trees

Binary trees can be pictured as a tree that has several nodes where the first node is the root and each nodes can have branches as left child and right child.

When it comes to binary trees, only a minimum of one sub-node and a maximum of two sub-nodes (childs) can be created.

There are several things to consider when it comes to binary trees which are the traversal types and in this project we would be using a **simple traversal** type without keeping in consideration of the **rules of Binary Search Trees**.

## Ways of Traversal
1. **Inorder traversal - left subtree -> root -> right subtree**
2. **Preorder traversal - root -> left subtree -> right subtree**
3. **Postorder traversal - left subtree -> right subtree -> root**

Note:
You can clone this repo for your own use to learn how binary search works.
Contrubutions are also allowed.
